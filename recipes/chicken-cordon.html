  <h2>Chicken Marsala</h2>
  <p>
    All the flavors of traditional chicken cordon bleu but keto-friendly and much easier to assemble since there is no
    stuffing or rolling involved.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound chicken cutlets, pounded to 1/4-inch thickness</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>⅔ cup almond flour</li>
      <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>¼ cup avocado oil</li>
      <li>¼ pound shaved deli ham</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Swiss cheese</li>
    </ul>
  </h3>

  <h3>Directions
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Season chicken cutlets with salt and pepper; set aside.</li>
      <li>Whisk eggs and Dijon mustard together in a shallow bowl. Combine almond flour, Parmesan cheese, and garlic
        powder in a separate shallow bowl. Dip chicken cutlets into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Dredge with
        almond flour mixture, then set on a plate.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken cutlets and cook until golden brown, 3 to 4
        minutes. Flip over and cook until chicken is no longer pink inside and the juices are running clear, 3 to 4
        minutes more.</li>
      <li>Place chicken cutlets on a baking sheet. Top with ham slices and cover with Swiss cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese has melted, 4 to 5 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
